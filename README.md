On the first push towards remembering Java - 134 lines of code in one go, on march 3rd 2021 - the following topics were taken upon: Syntax, comments, variables, data types, type casting, operators, strings, math, booleans, if..else, switch, while loop, for loop, break/continue, arrays.
 
So far so good, looking foward for the next section: Java Methods (including: Methods, method parameters, method overloading, scope, recursion).

On this secound section, 120 lines of code was writting, on march 4rth 2021, two new folder were created inside the src folder. A basics folder for the last time i pushed foward into remembering java, and a folder for java methods. In java methods it was covered methods, returning methods with multiple parameters, method overloading, scope, recursion, recursion halting.

looking foward into next time, where classes will be explored.
