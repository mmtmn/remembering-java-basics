This repository is going to be used to remember the basics of Java for my 5th semester in Computer Science, during 2021.
 
 ## Java Syntax

On the first push towards remembering Java - 134 lines of code in one go, on march 3rd 2021 - the following topics were taken upon: Syntax, comments, variables, data types, type casting, operators, strings, math, booleans, if..else, switch, while loop, for loop, break/continue, arrays.
 
So far so good, looking foward for the next section: Java Methods (including: Methods, method parameters, method overloading, scope, recursion).

On this second section, 120 lines of code was writting, on march 4rth 2021, two new folder were created inside the src folder. Now this repo will have its own folder for each section. This time around, it was covered methods, returning them with multiple parameters, overloading them, how the scopes work in java, recursion funcionalities and recursion halting.

looking foward to next time, where classes will be explored to their limits.
