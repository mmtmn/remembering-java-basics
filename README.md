 This repository is going to be used to remeber Java for my 5th semester in Computer Science, during 2021.

On the first push towards remembering Java, 134 lines of code in one go, in march 3rd 2021, the following topics were taken upon: Syntax, comments, variables, data types, type casting, operators, strings, math, booleans, if..else, switch, while loop, for loop, break/continue, arrays.
 
So far so good, looking foward for the next section: Java Methods (including: Methods, method parameters, method overloading, scope, recursion).
